h1. Scheme-Cpp

A lightweight C++ wrapper around TinyScheme (http://tinyscheme.sourceforge.net/home.html)

h2. Building

OS X and Linux is the only supported platforms for the moment, and you will need CMake to generate the requires Makefile.

Create a build folder, this step is optional, but it's encouraged. It makes cleaning up a lot easier, especially because CMake creates a lot of files all over the place:
@mkdir build@
@cd build@

Generate makefiles for the project:
@cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..@

Compile:
@make@

h2. Example

A simple example on how to use the library.

Start by creating an instance of the Interpreter.
@script::Interpreter eval;@

Next we can execute some code, here we define a function called add.
@eval.loadScript("(define (add a b) (+ a b))");@

Then we can call our new function, and get back the result.
@script::Cell result = eval.call("add", 1, 2);@

And lastly we can access the result.
@int value = result.toInteger();@
